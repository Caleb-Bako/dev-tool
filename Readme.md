You’ll only need to learn about:

fs (for making folders & files)

path (for joining file paths)

process.argv (to read what the user typed, like my-app)

Next Step — Grow slowly 
After your MVP works, you can level up step by step:

🧩 Level 1	Create folders/files -> fs, path, process.argv
💬 Level 2	Ask user questions -> inquirer
🚀 Level 3	Make it a global CLI -> npm link, commander
🧠 Level 4	Copy pre-made template files -> fs.copyFile or fs-extra
🎨 Level 5	Create package.json and Replace placeholders (e.g., project name)
🧰 Level 7	Add options (like database) -> CLI arguments & branching
💎 Level 8	Polish (spinners, colors, git init) -> chalk, ora, simple-git
